# AML_FinalProject
## Methods:
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Neural Networks
## Pip libs used:
- SciKit Learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
## How to run
- Run any of the .py files to get their relavent outputs
- The demo.py file is already populated with the most common best outputs and shows how weak or even fake this dataset is, which is explained more in the report.
- **CAUTION** The method files run to find the best parameters for their method and takes quite a while, even with multiprocessing. Up to 30 minutes.
## Report
The Report pdf has a detailed report on each method, and why none of the methods are accurate predictors
